Certainly! I'll enhance the provided implementation based on the suggestions:

## Implementing the Enhanced Circuit Breaker Pattern in NestJS

### **Step 1: Create the Circuit Breaker Interceptor**
*(This remains the same as your previous implementation.)*

### **Step 2: Define the Circuit Breaker State**
*(This remains the same as your previous implementation, with minor adjustments in descriptions.)*

```ts
enum CircuitBreakerState {
  CLOSED,
  OPEN,
  HALF_OPEN,
}
```

- `CLOSED`: The circuit is functioning normally, and requests to the external service are allowed.
- `OPEN`: When the failure count exceeds a certain threshold, the circuit transitions to the OPEN state, rejecting all requests until a certain time. 
- `HALF_OPEN`: Allows a few requests to verify if the system under protection has recovered.

### **Step 3: Define the Circuit Breaker Interceptor properties**

```ts
@Injectable()
export class CircuitBreakerInterceptor implements NestInterceptor {
  private state = CircuitBreakerState.CLOSED
  private failureCount = 0
  private successCount = 0
  private lastError: Error
  private nextAttempt: number
  private readonly SUCCESS_THRESHOLD = 5  // Configurable
  private readonly FAILURE_THRESHOLD = 3  // Configurable
  private readonly OPEN_TO_HALF_OPEN_WAIT_TIME = 10 * 60 * 1000  // 10 minutes, also configurable
}
```

### **Step 4: Implement the `intercept` Method**
*(This remains the same as your previous implementation.)*

### **Step 5: Define the Success Handling Method**

```ts
private handleSuccess() {
  this.failureCount = 0
  if (this.state === CircuitBreakerState.HALF_OPEN) {
    this.successCount++

    if (this.successCount >= this.SUCCESS_THRESHOLD) {
      this.successCount = 0
      this.state = CircuitBreakerState.CLOSED
      console.log('Circuit State: CLOSED')  // Added for logging purposes
    }
  }
}
```

### **Step 6: Define the Error Handling Method**

```ts
private handleError(error: Error) {
  this.failureCount++

  if (this.failureCount >= this.FAILURE_THRESHOLD || this.state === CircuitBreakerState.HALF_OPEN) {
    this.state = CircuitBreakerState.OPEN
    this.lastError = error
    this.nextAttempt = Date.now() + this.OPEN_TO_HALF_OPEN_WAIT_TIME
    console.log(`Circuit State: OPEN. Next attempt at: ${new Date(this.nextAttempt)}`)  // Added for logging purposes
  }
}
```

### **Step 7: Transition Logic from OPEN to HALF_OPEN**

This logic will check, based on time, whether the circuit should transition from OPEN to HALF_OPEN.

```ts
private checkAndTransitionFromOpen() {
  if (this.state === CircuitBreakerState.OPEN && Date.now() > this.nextAttempt) {
    this.state = CircuitBreakerState.HALF_OPEN;
    console.log('Circuit State: HALF_OPEN')  // Added for logging purposes
  }
}
```

Make sure to call `checkAndTransitionFromOpen()` in the `intercept` method before the `next.handle()`.

### **Step 8: Implement the Circuit Breaker Logic in the Application**

*(This remains the same as your previous implementation.)*

### **Step 9: Testing the Circuit Breaker Pattern**

To test the implementation:
1. Intentionally throw errors in a route to simulate the CLOSED -> OPEN transition.
2. Adjust the `OPEN_TO_HALF_OPEN_WAIT_TIME` for faster testing and check the transition from OPEN -> HALF_OPEN -> CLOSED.
3. Monitor the console logs to verify the transitions.

By following this enhanced implementation, you'll have a more robust and configurable Circuit Breaker pattern integrated into your NestJS application.
